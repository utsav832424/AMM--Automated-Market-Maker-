# Automated Market Maker (AMM) in Solidity

This repository contains a smart contract implementation of an Automated Market Maker (AMM) in Solidity. The AMM allows the creation of liquidity pools, adding/removing liquidity, swapping tokens, and fetching quotes for token swaps.

## Features

- **Create Liquidity Pools**: The contract owner can create new pools for ERC-20 token pairs.
- **Add Liquidity**: Liquidity Providers (LPs) can contribute to any existing pool.
- **Withdraw Liquidity**: LPs can withdraw their share from any pool.
- **Swap Tokens**: Users can swap tokens within the available pools.
- **Fetch Quotes**: Users can get quotes for token swaps to know the amount they will receive.
